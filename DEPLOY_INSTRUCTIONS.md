# 🚀 Fix: Show Website Instead of Documentation

## The Problem
GitHub Pages is showing the repository documentation instead of your beautiful Yolda website.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/MukhammadTukhsanov/lending-yolda`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Make sure **Source** is set to **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")

### Step 2: Trigger a New Deployment
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make sure everything is built
npm run build

# Add and commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Deploy: Show website instead of documentation"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Check the Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Wait for the "🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to complete (green checkmark ✅)
3. Visit your live site: **https://mukhammadtukhsanov.github.io/lending-yolda**

### Step 4: Alternative URLs to Try
If the main URL shows documentation, try:
- `https://mukhammadtukhsanov.github.io/lending-yolda/`
- `https://mukhammadtukhsanov.github.io/lending-yolda/index.html`

## Why This Happens

GitHub has two different views:
1. **Repository view** (documentation) - when you visit the repo directly
2. **GitHub Pages view** (your website) - when you visit the Pages URL

Make sure you're visiting the **GitHub Pages URL**, not the repository URL.

## Quick Fix Command

```bash
# Run this command to deploy immediately
git add . && git commit -m "🚀 Deploy website" && git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
✅ Your website should show the beautiful Yolda landing page with:
- Orange gradient background
- App download buttons
- Interactive bubbles
- Contact form
- Multi-language support

❌ NOT the GitHub documentation/README
