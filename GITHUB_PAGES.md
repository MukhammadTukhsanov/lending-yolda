   - Click "Save"

## 🔧 What We've Set Up

### ✅ Automatic Deployment
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys on every push to `main`
- Optimized build process for production

### ✅ Single Page App Support
- Proper routing for React applications
- 404.html handling for GitHub Pages
- SPA redirect script for navigation

### ✅ Production Configuration
- Correct PUBLIC_URL for GitHub Pages
- Optimized build settings
- Environment-specific configurations

### ✅ Asset Optimization
- PNG favicon instead of ICO
- Proper manifest.json configuration
- Meta tags for SEO and social sharing

## 🎯 Expected Result

Instead of seeing the React documentation, visitors will see:
- ✨ Beautiful Yolda landing page
- 📱 Responsive design that works on all devices
- 📧 Working contact form (when PHP backend is deployed)
- 🎨 Modern animations and effects
- 📊 Professional layout with features, testimonials, and CTA sections

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you see the documentation page:
1. Check that GitHub Actions has completed successfully
2. Verify Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Clear your browser cache and try again
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub's CDN to update

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all files are committed and pushed
3. Verify package.json homepage URL is correct
4. Try running `npm run build` locally to check for errors

### If contact form doesn't work:
- The contact form requires a PHP server
- For GitHub Pages (static hosting), you'll need to either:
  - Use a form service like Formspree or Netlify Forms
  - Deploy to a hosting service that supports PHP
  - Use serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify Functions)

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify your repository settings
3. Make sure all changes are committed and pushed
4. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, you'll have a professional, modern landing page that showcases the Yolda delivery service with:
- Hero section with app download buttons
- Feature highlights
- Customer testimonials
- Contact form
- Beautiful animations and responsive design

Your visitors will see the actual website instead of React documentation! 🚀
